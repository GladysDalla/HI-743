# 🏥 Predicting High-Cost Members & Segmenting Risk Profiles

A real-world healthcare predictive analytics project using the MEPS 2020 dataset to help insurers identify high-cost members and segment populations for risk management and intervention.

## 📌 Objective

Use publicly available healthcare data to:
- Predict which members are likely to incur high medical costs
- Segment members into actionable risk profiles
- Support care management, underwriting, and cost control strategies

## 🧪 Project Pipeline

All code and logic are included in a single R Markdown file: `main.Rmd`

## 🛠 Setup Instructions

1. Place the `h216.ssp` file in the `/data/` folder  
2. Open the project in RStudio  
3. Knit `main.Rmd` to HTML  
4. All steps — data cleaning, segmentation, prediction, and visuals — will run end-to-end
